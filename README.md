Ideal for rapid development of complex platforms like TicketA. |
| **<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/PostgreSQL-4169E1?logo=postgresql&logoColor=white" alt="PostgreSQL" />** | Relational database system. | Chosen for **ACID compliance**, **performance** with large datasets (e.g., event/ticket records), and **Django‚Äôs native support**. Supports JSON fields for flexible event metadata. |

|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Tailwind_CSS-06B6D4?logo=tailwind-css&logoColor=white" alt="Tailwind CSS" />** | Utility-first CSS framework. | Enables **rapid UI development** with responsive design out-of-the-box.

Integrates seamlessly with Django templates. |
| **<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/HTMX-1E4A75?logo=html5&logoColor=white" alt="HTMX" />** | Library for dynamic HTML. | Allows **AJAX-like behavior** (e.g., filtering events, cart updates) without writing JavaScript. Reduces frontend complexity while maintaining interactivity. |

### **Services**  
| Technology | Description | Why It Was Chosen |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Stripe-008CDD?logo=stripe&logoColor=white" alt="Stripe" />** | Payment processing API. | Industry-standard for **secure transactions**, supports **global payments**, and handles PCI compliance. Django‚Äôs Stripe library simplifies integration. |
